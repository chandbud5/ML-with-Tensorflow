# Cats v/s Dogs Classifier

This binary classifier uses real world dataset from **Kaggle**.
It contains 25000 images of cats and dogs, for their classification I have made a 
model which uses ImageDataGenerator for Augmentation and Convolutional Neural Network<br><br>

## To see the effect of Augmentation we will see the plots in both the cases

### On the basis of above figure we can infer that
* Previously, our model was overfitted as training accuracy was around 100% and validation accuracy was quite low.
* While after applying Augmentation it saved our model from overfitting as due to augmentation our model gets variation in dataset.
* Accuracy was increasing slowly in augmentation as compared to previous one.
