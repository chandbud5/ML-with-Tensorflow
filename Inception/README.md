# Transfer Learning

* Transfer learning is a concept which helps us to use pre trained models which are trained by others on different datasets. With transfer learning we just use their model and weights of different neurons.<br>
* In this project we are going to use pre trained model called **Inception V3** which is trained on dataset from [*ImageNet*](http://www.image-net.org/). This dataset of ImageNet has 1.4 Million images and 1000 different classes.<br>
* So Inception is trained on this whole dataset for very long time and it has extracted features during it's training.<br>
* We will be using it to clssify between Horses and Humans. Download dataset of Horses and Humans from [***HERE***](http://www.laurencemoroney.com/horses-or-humans-dataset/)
